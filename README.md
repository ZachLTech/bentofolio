# [Bentofolio](https://bentofolio.zachl.tech)

Bentofolio is my personal portfolio project that showcases my skills and expertise through a bento grid-style layout. Built using Nuxt.js and TailwindCSS, it offers an interactive and visually appealing interface. The project also includes SwiperJS for smooth navigation and integrates GitHub readme stats for dynamic data visualization.

## Features

- **Bento Grid Layout**: A clean, organized layout to display various aspects of my work and skills.
- **Nuxt.js**: Provides a powerful and flexible framework for building a modern web application.
- **TailwindCSS**: Offers a highly customizable styling framework for rapid UI development.
- **SwiperJS**: Enables smooth, responsive sliders for an interactive experience.
- **GitHub Readme Stats**: Integrates dynamic stats to showcase my GitHub activity and programming language usage (credit to [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)).
- **Mobile Support**: Although it doesn't look as impressive with such a small screen, this website does work on mobile and all the same information is still reachable
- **Docker Support**: For self hosting on my server I added the ability do containerize this website

## Usage

- Navigate through the grid to explore various sections, including skills, projects, and personal information.
- View dynamic GitHub stats to learn about my coding activity and preferred technologies.
- Click on project cards to read descriptions and see technology stacks. (Via a github readme)
